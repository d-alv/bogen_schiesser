color recommendations: 

What I think the best idea is: 

after the little "break" in the color palette - the one that says is picked palette or something - 
the second section seems to work REALLY WELL  - in the sense that the camera can still differentiate this
color from the other ones regardless of the shade, really is quite remarkable. 

I think this color will make it stand out a lot more, and recognize the target more reliably regardless of the 
time of the day. 

However, if it is at night (which I do not really do archery at that time of night, but it probably
would not work so well at night).
