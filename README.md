get your accuracy up

Project revolving around opencv color tracking and application of physics to improve my 
accuracy in archery. Reformat.py launches the main program which relies on the other files to 
give audio signals to how close I am to hitting the target as well as measuring angle and distance
using trigonometric principles to calculate the arrow's predicted trajectory. 

AS OF LATEST UPDATE

Trajectory system is flawed - beeps come too late and the arrow flies lower than expected - 
possibly due to position of arrow knock on string?
