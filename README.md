get your accuracy up

Project revolving around opencv color tracking and application of physics to improve my 
accuracy in archery. Reformat.py launches the main program which relies on the other files to 
give audio signals to how close I am to hitting the target as well as measuring angle and distance
using trigonometric principles to calculate the arrow's predicted trajectory. 

AS OF LATEST UPDATE

Trajectory fixed, can function without monitor - LED shows accuracy level.

What's next? 
##############################
Precision will be adjustable, based on how much help is wanted. High - hits middle of target, medium = general middle, low - only alerts if missing target completely

- once this is done, I will work on making the wires less intrusive and stabilize raspberry pi.
